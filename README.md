## üîß‚ÄÄIndependent settings

Some of the settings in the project do not have corresponding commands, and
operate based entirely on events.

| Setting            | Scope   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------ | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `badnames`         | Server  | A comma-separated list of substrings to search for in usernames to auto-kick.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `greet.channel`    | Server  | The channel where greeting messages should be sent. Defaults to an empty value. Both the channel and message must be set before this feature will be enabled.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `greet.message`    | Server  | The message that will be used to greet new users when they join the server. If set to the default, no greeting will be posted. You may use the `{name}` token in your message, and it will be replaced with the new member's username. The `{mention}` token will mention the user. The `{nl}` token will be replaced with a line break (new line). |
| `nameonly`         | Server  | If set to anything other than the default value, the bot will only respond if it is mentioned directly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `nameonly.channel` | Channel | Like `nameonly`, but this setting applies to individual channels.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `prefix`           | Server  | Change the bot's command prefix. (Default: `!`) The bot will respond when mentioned directly, regardless of this setting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
